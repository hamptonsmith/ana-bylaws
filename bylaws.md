# $orgName Neighborhood Association

Established $orgDate

## Purpose

To gather and distribute information pertaining to the neighborhood's development to all members, and to facilitate communication with the city and county of Greenville, and any other relevant governmental body. The Association is not an HOA, and has no specific authority over its members; it exists entirely as a channel between members and local representatives, developers, businesses, or any other third party with interests, business, or activity within the Neighborhood.

## Geographical Limits

Enveloped by the minimal area within Laurens Road, Airport Road, and jointly Industrial Drive and Commercial Drive.

Containing Sycamore Drive, Lindsay Avenue, Boland Street, Ridgeway Avenue, Aniwetauk Street, Simmons Avenue, Ridgeway Drive, Ridge Knoll Circle, Eastwood Court, Travis Street, and Utica Street.

## Membership

All adults residing within or owning residences within the geographical limits.

## Meetings

Association meetings shall be held on demand, on the first Monday of the month, at 7pm, with a location announced no less than a week before the date, and with the meeting announced no less than two weeks before the date.

Anyone connected to the Neighborhood or the topics under discussion may attend meetings.

Members may vote.

All present at a meeting shall be considered sufficient for a vote.

The $orgOrganizer or a selected delegate shall moderate meetings, presenting the topics for discussion, directing those presenting information or proposals to speak, and helping keep order as members ask questions or volunteer relevant information.

## Actions

### Requesting information

As the NA exists to facilitate information, any member may request that the $orgOrganizer gather information on a specific concern from the relevant government agents; however, members are free to request this information directly and share it with the NA as well.

### Distributing Information

The $orgOrganizer will present all information they received from the city and other relevant parties to the Association through email or some relevant online forum. This includes new development, proposals from members, and news pertinent to the Neighborhood generally.

### Making a suggestion / requesting work

Any member wishing to bring a proposal to the attention of our representatives via the Association may present it to the $orgOrganizer for consideration at a meeting.

NOTE: if we have some form of non-in-person voting, we could hypothetically avoid the need for in-person meetings.


A proposal with no suggested amendments or objections may move directly to vote.

Proposals with a simple majority will get passed on to officials from the Association.

Suggested amendments may be considered as they come up, prior to voting on the proposal to which they belong; if the amendment gets a simple majority, the proposal can be altered prior to voting on it.

In the case of any objections to a proposal, either an amendment may be suggested to ameliorate the objection, or a (? 2/3 or 4/5 ?) vote may dismiss the objection. Otherwise, the proposal must be amended or rejected, or tabled for a later meeting.

A quick sense vote may be taken at any time for any purpose: thumbs up, thumbs down.
## Some definitions

**Proposal**: a request, concern, or suggestion about development, planning, construction, or other topics pertinent to the Neighborhood

Proposals ought to have a background, laying out any necessary information for unstanding the proposal, the proposed action/suggestion/concern, and ideally an action plan for presenting this to the relevant officials.

Examples: This could be as simple as asking to email the city about improving paving, or as complex as petitioning a construction company to alter plans.

For the best proposal:
1. Talk to your neighbors and other Association members. See if other people share your ideas and concerns.
2. Write your idea in the standard proposal format, which will allow everyone to more easily understand your idea.
3. Take you idea to the $orgOrganizer.
4. Present the item at the meeting and respond to questions.

**Amendment**: a change to a proposal; this could be to clarify its intent, to add specifics, to change essentials, to help consensus, or to adopt an alternative. It must be accepted by the proposal author or voted on if not.

**$orgOrganizer**: an elected member who directs meetings and is responsible for gathering and distributing information.

A different facilitator (discussion leader) volunteers for each item during the meeting. The facilitator guides the discussion through the process described by the flowchart. Any personal views voiced by the facilitator must be identified as such. The facilitator, as we describe them, has three responsibilities:
- Add names to the speakerâ€™s list as members raise their hands, then call on them in turn. The facilitator must put themselves on this list, just like everyone else.
- Sense when the discussion has been effective or is stuck, and announce that the process has moved to general feelings.
- Create an open and safe atmosphere in which people feel free to voice and accept criticisms, ensuring that all those who would like to speak get their voices heard in a respectful manner.


**Motion**: during a meeting: a call to vote on a proposal, to get a sense vote, to suggest an amendment, to present an objection, or any other formal action contained in the Association Defition. Motions need a second unless they are part of the normal flow of meeting discussion.

**Call to Vote**: A request to cut off the conversation on a certain topic and call a vote right then.

**Table**: to end discussion of a topic at the current meeting, usually to be taken up at a later meeting.

**Stack**: a list of people in the order in which they raised their hands to speak on the current topic.

**Floor**: the current focus of attention, the person speaking "has the floor"; they may speak as long as they have allotted time, or choose to respond to questions or yield the floor to another speaker.

**Applause**: waving your fingers in the air to silently convey approval or agreement with the current speaker. (This is ASL for applause).

**Point of Information**: When you know a fact that has a direct bearing on the discussion, and without which the discussion would not correctly be resolved. Signaled with a triangle made with thumbs and pointer fingers.

**Direct Response**: when you wish to directly address what is being said, or ask a question, and wish to ask the speakers permission to interrupt and say your piece; indicated by putting up your hand with your index finger up.

**Round Robin**: when each person holds the floor until they are done, and then the floor goes to the person next to them, until the floor has been passed to each person in the room.
